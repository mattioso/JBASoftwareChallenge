# JBASoftwareChallenge
A repo to hold the code for the JBA software challenge

The provided data had inconsistencies, with how the data was written, so I manually normalized it
Grid values changed: (28, 222), (49, 221), (49, 222), (50, 221), (107, 280)
Data given lacked spacing between months, I extrapolated, based on the style and format of the file where the spaces between months would go, and placed them in manually
In a real situation, I would ask the creator of the data to send me the correct data for these grid values. I modified the data in order to move forward with the project knowing that it would be easy to retrospectively change the data later on in the project

On my computer, the solution takes 1.303 seconds.
It generates a comma separated file which can easily be converted to a spreadsheet, or used elsewhere
